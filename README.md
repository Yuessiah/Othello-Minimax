# Installation

`$ git clone https://github.com/Yuessiah/Othello-Negamax`

# Usage

`$ ./Othello-Negamax/reversi.py --help` can see what option can use:
```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --timeout TIMEOUT  Number of seconds the brain is allowed to think before
                     making its move
  --text             Display the game in text mode
  --player           Player first
  --ai               AI first
  --verify           Verify AI using a random player
```
if have not any arguments, the game will start for two human player.

I suggest using [pypy3.5](https://pypy.org/download.html) interpreter for more faster performance.
